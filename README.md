# Hi, everyone 👋

## About me 

🎓 Systems Analysis and Development @ UNINTER | 📍 Guarujá - SP, Brazil  

🌐 Technology student focused on building clean, responsive and accessible web interfaces.  
🎯 Aspiring Front-End Developer, passionate about transforming design into interactive and scalable digital experiences.

I'm currently specializing in Front-End development with technologies like **React.js**, **TypeScript**, and **JavaScript**, while also exploring design principles such as **UX/UI**, **responsive layout**, and **component-based architecture**. 

My background includes real project experience in agile teams (Scrum), contributing to tasks like documentation, daily meetings, and collaborative problem solving. I’m constantly evolving and eager to apply my knowledge to create intuitive solutions that generate real value for users.
